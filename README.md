This Android application, which is new, was created with Kotlin and Android Studio. It enables users to look up food items and store the information using the Room library. The Retrofit library is utilized by the application to get data from a food API and then use the DAO interface to save it to the local database.

Functionality includes allowing users to search for food items by name, retrieve data from a food API, save it to a local database using the Room library, and view the saved data in a RecyclerView.

The app was created using Kotlin, Android Studio, the Room library, and a public API. To use the app, Android Studio and the necessary dependencies must be installed on your device. Simply clone the repository, open it in Android Studio, and build and run it on an Android device or emulator.
